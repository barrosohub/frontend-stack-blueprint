# Why React

## Decision

React ≥19.2 as the UI rendering framework for all projects.

## Reasons

1. **Ecosystem dominance** — Largest ecosystem of libraries, tools, and community support in the frontend space. More packages, tutorials, and battle-tested solutions than any alternative.

2. **Talent pool** — Most frontend developers know React. Hiring, onboarding, and team scaling are significantly easier.

3. **Corporate backing** — Meta-maintained with consistent releases and long-term commitment. React 19 introduced significant improvements (Server Components, Actions, use() hook).

4. **Component model** — Function components + hooks provide a clean, composable architecture that aligns with modern JavaScript patterns.

5. **AI agent compatibility** — React is the framework with the most training data for LLMs. AI coding agents generate better React code than any alternative.

6. **Framework flexibility** — React is a library, not a framework. It works with any routing, state management, or build tool — aligning with our modular stack philosophy.

7. **React Compiler** — Upcoming compiler will automatically optimize re-renders, eliminating manual memoization and making React the most performant option.

## Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Why Not                                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Vue 3       | Smaller ecosystem, fewer AI training examples           |
| Svelte 5    | Promising but ecosystem still maturing                  |
| Solid.js    | Excellent performance but tiny ecosystem                |
| Angular     | Opinionated framework conflicts with modular philosophy |

## Status

✅ Core — This decision is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future.
